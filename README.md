## Spotify - Clustering of support tickets using NLP methods

> **Data** - [Spotify Support Ticket Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15v-7NsMuhHZctsyGRfB_HazXsydEBpw5/view)

**The task**

The task is to write a Python program that clusters these messages in terms of similarity and outputs the results into 
a file (the representation is up to you, as long as it can be interpreted with relative ease).

The similarity criteria are up to you to decide, including the number of clusters and which of the attributes you use. 
You MUST use text-similarity of the message_body attribute as one of the criteria.
